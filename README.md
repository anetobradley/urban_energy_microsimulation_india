# Urban residential energy microsimulation toolkit for India
Tools for generating urban synthetic populations for India, and running energy transition microsimulations.

REPO IS STILL BEING ASSEMBLED - SOME FILES STILL MISSING

# Data Sources
This toolkit is designed to work with the following public data sources which can be found online.

- Census Ward Level Tables
- Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS) 
- NSS Consumer Expenditure Survey (NSS)
- Shapefile of Census City Ward Map

Sample results and outputs have been generated using data fora given city from these sources.
